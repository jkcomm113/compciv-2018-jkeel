# Final project readme

I would like my project to analyze the wealth of members of congress over time. For example, though their income for being a member of congress “slid to their lowest inflation-adjusted levels since December 1990,” most of them have higher net worth and were already well off before joining . I suspect that despite the halt on their pay, most of them are getting paid in other ways or have ties to other ventures that allow them to increase their worth. And I believe they are rejecting pay raises because of the political environment in D.C where many public service workers are struggling financially. In addition, by appearing to be one with the middle class, they are earning brownie points with the public. Despite the block, the net worth is increasing, and it will be interesting to analyze and investigate this by looking at the financial reports available online. Many news sources as well as academic institutions like Stanford are bring this issue to attention. In a time where much of the public except for an exceptional few groups are unpleased with the way government is running, it will be interesting to see how much of this disdain truly affects Congress members financially. Furthermore, I want to investigate the personal wealth needed to become a leader or voice for this country and whether people of economically humble backgrounds can even think to join congress.

For my project, I want to specifically focus on California, Washington State, and Texas to investigate the senators. This is because both California and Washington State are wealthy states, and have a younger, more politically active crowd than most. I believe they are the leaders in making political change and are effective in bringing to light the corruption and socioeconomic inequality present in the country. On the other hand, Texas is a more conservative, Republican state at the moment. However, many of their representatives are wealthy. I would like to see if there are any differences in net worth over the past 5 years for the senators that represent California, Washington State, and Texas and see if they parallel the political beliefs and environment of their respective states.
